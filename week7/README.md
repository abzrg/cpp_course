## NOTES

- Multiple versions of definitions are provided. You can comment/uncomment to test
each one. But notice to use the proper compiler standard through compiler's
`-std=<standard>` option.

- Encapsulation of the source code into files `matrix.cpp`, `matrix.h` and
`main.cpp` was an error prone and tedious task, as you have to precede all
definitions with almost exact template parameter list and SFINAE.
