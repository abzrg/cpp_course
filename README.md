# C++ programming course

## Refrences
The home for the 2021 version of the course is
[here](https://www.hni.uni-paderborn.de/en/sse/teaching/cppp/).

## DISCLAIMER
This repository is only for my use to document my progress during the
course. Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the
problems yourself, as it's totally pointless (if you actually wanna learn how to
write software) and a blatant violation of the policy[^1] of the course.


[^1]:
    Note: If you copy text or code elements from other sources, clearly mark
    those elements and state the source. Copying solutions from other students
    is prohibited.
